The purpose of this application 
is to demostrate my ability to create a program that can hash and store a password in a database.

The appliation is built using Python, FLASK, Jinja, javascript, css, 
bootstraps. 

The database is a PostgreSQL database. I use SQL Alchemy to connect
the application to the database. 

One thing that is missing is the secret.py file for the application 
to work. Please creat a new file with a variable named "secret_key" 
followed by a string. 

All dependencies will be in the requirements.txt file.
